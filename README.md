#APÂ© Computer Science `Magic Square`

I spent a lot of time making the MagicSquareGenerator, which generates a Square for ANY size (with the limitation of buffer overflow, and memory on your computer), but there was a requirement to limit it to 8. If you want to see it generate a bigger one (please do) comment out line 49 in the main class. Also uncomment line 51.
